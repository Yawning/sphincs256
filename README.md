### SPHINCS: practical stateless hash-based signatures
#### Yawning Angel (yawning at schwanenlied dot me)

This is a straight forward port of the ref SPHINCS-256 implementation from
SUPERCOP (20141014).  Regardless of how "new" the primitive is ("very" as of
this writing), the port was done by someone that got bored and probably should
not be used by anybody.  There is no warranty.

Dependencies:
 * https://github.com/dchest/blake256
 * https://github.com/dchest/blake512

Implementor's notes:
 * As far as I can tell the use of ChaCha12 for the entropy expansion routine is
   an arbitrary one.  Since the hash permutation uses ChaCha12 anyway, there is
   no reason not to keep this the same.
 * Likewise, the use of BLAKE-256 and BLAKE-512 also appears to be arbitrary,
   and any other cryptographic hash functions can be used, as long as identical
   algorithms are used at signing and verification time, and the digest length
   is as expected.
 * As far as the port goes, it is rather naive and mostly emphasizes correctness
   over anything else.  Since this is based off the reference implementation and
   is using pure Go for everything, it is extremely slow.  If better performance
   is desired, send a patch to use the "avx2" code.
 * golang not having C/C++ style "const" still makes me really sad.

TODO:
 * Clean up the code.
 * Test vs the SUPERCOP implementation.
 * Make it go fast.
 * Support detached signatures.
